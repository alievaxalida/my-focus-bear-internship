Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

🔍 Research & Learn

**What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?**
Daily Stand-ups: Short daily meetings to share progress, plans, and blockers.
Sprint Planning (Scrum) / Continuous Prioritization (Kanban): Decide which tasks to do next and plan priorities.
Retrospectives: Meetings to discuss what went well, what can improve, and next steps.
Backlog Refinement: Review and update tasks in the backlog, making them clear and ready for work.

**How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?**
Teams use tools like Slack, email, or project boards. Updates, comments, and documentation let people work without needing everyone online at the same time.

📝 Reflection

**How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**
Ceremonies make sure everyone knows priorities, shares progress, and solves problems quickly. They keep the team aligned and reduce misunderstandings.

**Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?**
Daily Stand-ups are most important for me as a Manual QA. I can share testing progress, report bugs, and learn what developers are working on.

🛠️ Task

**Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.**
I haven't attended a live stand-up yet, but I have scheduled time to join the next available session to observe the team's update style.

**Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.**
I am currently reviewing the shared documentation and past meeting notes to understand how the team identifies areas for improvement.

**Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.**
I will ensure my GitHub issues are always linked to the relevant Kanban columns so the team can track my progress asynchronously, even if I'm in a different time zone.
