Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

🔍 Research & Learn

**What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?**
Agile is a way of managing projects where work is done step by step and the team can change plans easily. The team works in short periods (called iterations) and gets regular feedback from the customer.

Traditional project management (like Waterfall) is different. In this method, the whole plan is made at the beginning, and each step is done one after another. Changes are hard to make later.

**What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)**
Core Values: People and teamwork are more important than tools, a working product is more important than long documents, talking with the customer is more important than strict contracts, being flexible is more important than following a fixed plan.

Main Principles: Deliver small parts of the product often, accept changes, work together as a team, listen to the customer, always try to improve.

**What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?**
Scrum works in short time periods called sprints (for example, 2 weeks). The team plans the work at the start of each sprint. Scrum is used when the project has clear goals and the team wants regular planning and reviews.

Kanban does not use sprints. Work moves continuously on a board. There is no fixed planning time. Kanban is used when work comes at any time and needs to be handled flexibly.

**Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?**
Kanban supports flexibility and ongoing work, which matches how Focus Bear works.

📝 Reflection

**What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**
The biggest benefits of Agile are flexibility and fast feedback. Agile helps teams adapt to changes easily and deliver small working parts quickly. It also improves teamwork and customer satisfaction.

The main challenges of Agile are less fixed planning and the need for strong communication. Without good teamwork and discipline, Agile projects can become disorganized.

**How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**
Agile principles can help improve my role by making my work clearer and more flexible. I can focus on small tasks, get quick feedback, and fix problems early.

They also improve communication and teamwork, so I understand my responsibilities better. This helps me deliver better results and improve step by step.
