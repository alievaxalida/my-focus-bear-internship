🏆 Milestone: Working in a Scrum Team
🚀 Understanding Deployment & Hotfix Testing
🎯 Goal
Learn how QA testers contribute to deployment testing, post-release checks, and urgent hotfix validation.

❓ Why is this important?
Software releases don’t always go as planned. QA plays a key role in verifying deployments, catching last-minute issues, and ensuring that hotfixes don’t introduce new problems.

🔍 Research & Learn
**What is the difference between a scheduled release, a rollback, and a hotfix?**
Scheduled release: A planned update released at a set time.
Rollback: Going back to the previous version if something goes wrong.
Hotfix: A small, urgent fix released quickly to solve a critical issue.
**What should QA test immediately after a deployment?**
QA should test critical user flows, login, core features, payments (if any), and check that the app starts and works correctly.
**How does QA handle hotfix testing when a critical bug is found after release?**
QA tests only the affected area and related functions. They check that the bug is fixed and no new issues appear.
**What strategies help prevent new bugs from being introduced in urgent fixes?**
Test the fix carefully, do quick regression testing, and communicate closely with developers.
**How do other teams approach post-release monitoring?**
Teams monitor logs, error reports, analytics, and user feedback to find issues quickly.
📝 Reflection
**If a release goes live and users immediately report issues, what should QA do?**
QA should verify the issue, reproduce it, report it clearly, and help prioritize the fix.
**What’s the best way to prioritize testing when working under time pressure for a hotfix?**
Focus on critical functionality, the fix itself, and high-risk areas first.
**How can QA help ensure stability in production while still allowing fast bug fixes?**
By testing smartly, communicating quickly, and focusing on high-impact areas, QA helps keep production stable without slowing urgent fixes.
