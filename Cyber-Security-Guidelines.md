🎯 Goal

🔍 Research & Learn

**What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?**
Common threats are phishing emails, fake links, weak passwords, unsecured Wi-Fi, and malware.

**What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?**
Use strong passwords, update software regularly, lock your computer, and do not share accounts.

**Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?**
Because someone else can access your data and work systems without permission.

**How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?**
Do not click on them, do not download files, and report them to your team or IT.

**What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?**
A strong password is long and uses letters, numbers, and symbols. A password manager keeps passwords safe and helps avoid reuse.

**Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?**
2FA adds extra security to accounts. You should enable it on email, work tools, and important accounts.

📝 Reflection
**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**
I use passwords and lock my computer when I am away. I can improve by using stronger passwords and enabling 2FA on all important accounts.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**
I can make it a habit by always locking my screen, checking links carefully, and following the same security steps every day.

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**
I will use strong and unique passwords, use a password manager, and turn on 2FA.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**
I would change my password immediately, log out of all devices, enable 2FA, and report the issue to my team or IT.

🛠️ Task

Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.

Review your password storage method—if you’re not using a password manager, consider setting one up.

Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock (require a password or biometric login) if you are away for more than a few minutes
