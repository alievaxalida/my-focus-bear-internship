**Roles in an Agile Team**

🔍 Research & Learn

**What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?**
**Developers** build the product. They write code, fix bugs, and add new features.
**QA (Quality Assurance)** checks the product. They test the software and make sure it works correctly without problems.
**Product Manager (PM)** decides what to build. They understand customer needs, set priorities, and guide the product direction.
**Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)** helps the team work smoothly. They organize the process, remove problems, and support Agile practices.
**Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)** help the team in different ways.
Stakeholders give feedback and goals, UX designers improve user experience, and customer support shares user problems and needs.

**How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?**
In Scrum, the roles work together in fixed sprints. The team plans work at the start of the sprint, meets daily, and reviews results at the end. Roles like Product Manager, Developers, and QA have clear meetings and responsibilities.

In Kanban, the roles collaborate continuously. There are no fixed sprints or strict meetings. Developers and QA take tasks from the board as work becomes available, and the Product Manager updates priorities anytime.

**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**
My role is Manual QA Engineer. I contribute to the Agile process by testing the product step by step and finding bugs early.

I check new features, report problems clearly, and give feedback to the team. This helps the team improve the product, deliver quality work faster, and meet customer needs.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**
My responsibilities as a Manual QA closely interact with other roles in the team. I work with developers to explain bugs and help them fix issues. I also communicate with the Product Manager to understand requirements and priorities.

I give feedback to the team during testing so problems can be solved early. This teamwork helps everyone deliver a better product step by step.
