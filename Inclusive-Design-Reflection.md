🏆 Milestone: Company Policies
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Working with Vulnerable Populations
🎯 Goal
Understand how to interact respectfully and responsibly when working with or designing for vulnerable populations, including neurodivergent individuals.

❓ Why is this important?
Focus Bear is designed to support people with ADHD and Autism, as well as others who struggle with executive functioning. Many users face challenges with focus, motivation, and frustration tolerance, so we need to ensure our work is supportive, inclusive, and ethical.

Additionally, some of our own team members are neurodivergent, which means we should be mindful of communication styles, collaboration needs, and workplace accessibility for both users and colleagues.

🔍 Research & Learn
**Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?**
Vulnerable populations include people with ADHD, Autism, learning difficulties, mental health challenges, or disabilities. In digital spaces, they may struggle with too much information, confusing design, unclear instructions, and stress from notifications or time pressure.

**What ethical considerations are important when working with neurodivergent individuals?**
It is important to be respectful, patient, and inclusive. We should avoid overwhelming design, respect sensory needs, use clear communication, and never judge or blame users for difficulties.

**How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism?**
Use simple language, short sentences, and clear steps. Keep navigation predictable, reduce distractions, and avoid too many choices at one time.

**How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting?**
We can support them by communicating clearly, respecting different working styles, giving clear expectations, and allowing flexibility when possible.

📝 Reflection
**How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive?**
I can speak clearly, avoid vague messages, explain tasks step by step, and be patient and supportive in communication.

**What are common UX or communication pitfalls that might reduce accessibility?**
Too much text, unclear instructions, unexpected changes, complex navigation, and pressure-based language can make the product harder to use.

**One practical change you can make in your work**
I can write clearer bug reports and test instructions using simple language and clear steps.

🛠️ Task
**Insight from a first-person ADHD/Autism experience**
Many users say productivity tools feel overwhelming because of too many features, notifications, and pressure to “do more.”

**One improvement for Focus Bear**
Add clearer guidance, gentle reminders, and reduce visual or cognitive overload where possible.

**Supportive response to a user struggling with executive functioning**
*“Thanks for reaching out. It’s okay to feel stuck sometimes. You’re not doing anything wrong. Let’s take this one small step at a time. I’m here to help, and we can find a way that works best for you.”*
