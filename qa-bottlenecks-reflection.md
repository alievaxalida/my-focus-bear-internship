🏆 Milestone: Working in a Scrum Team
⚖️ Handling QA Bottlenecks in Sprints
🎯 Goal
Learn strategies to prevent QA from becoming a bottleneck in Agile sprints and keep testing aligned with development progress.

❓ Why is this important?
If QA falls behind, stories can get stuck in "In Testing", delaying releases. A strong QA process ensures that testing happens throughout the sprint, rather than piling up at the end.

🔍 Research & Learn
**Why do QA bottlenecks happen in Agile teams?**
QA bottlenecks happen when testing starts too late, many features are ready at the same time, or requirements are unclear. Sometimes QA has too many tasks and not enough time.
**How can testers avoid testing everything at the last minute?**
Testers can start testing early, test small parts step by step, and prepare test cases before development is finished.
**What is parallel testing, and how does it help keep QA on track?**
Parallel testing means QA tests features while developers are still building other features. This helps find bugs earlier and prevents too much testing at the end of the sprint.
**How do developers and testers collaborate to ensure smooth testing progress?**
They communicate daily, clarify requirements together, share progress in stand-ups, and fix bugs quickly. Early communication reduces delays.
**What techniques can help QA work more efficiently without compromising quality?**
Prioritizing critical features, reusing test cases, clear bug reports, and focusing on high-risk areas help QA work faster and better.

📝 Reflection
**If multiple features are ready for testing at the same time, how would you prioritize them?**
I would test high-priority and high-risk features first, especially those that affect core functionality.
**How can early involvement of QA prevent last-minute testing rushes?**
Early involvement helps QA understand requirements, prepare tests early, and catch issues before development is finished.
**What would you suggest to a team if QA keeps blocking releases due to late testing?**
I would suggest starting testing earlier, improving communication with developers, and spreading testing evenly across the sprint instead of at the end.
