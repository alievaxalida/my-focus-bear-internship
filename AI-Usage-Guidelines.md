🤖 Use of AI Tools
🎯 Goal
Understand how to responsibly and effectively use AI tools while maintaining data privacy and critical thinking.

❓ Why is this important?
AI tools can boost productivity, but they should be used thoughtfully. Misuse—such as leaking confidential information or relying on AI without critical thinking—can cause serious problems.

🔍 Research & Learn

**What AI tools are typically used for your role?**
AI tools can help with test case writing, bug report suggestions, test data generation, and understanding requirements faster. They save time and help with ideas, but they do not replace testing.
**What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?**
Benefits are saving time, working faster, and getting help with analysis. Risks are wrong information, data leaks, and trusting AI too much without checking.
**What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?**
Passwords, personal data, company secrets, client data, financial information, and confidential work documents should never be shared.
**How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?**
You should review the content yourself, compare it with official documents or requirements, test it in real scenarios, and ask the team if something is unclear.

📝 Reflection

**When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**
I use AI for help with ideas, explanations, and saving time. I rely on my own skills for testing, decision-making, and final results.

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**
I can use AI as a support tool, not a replacement. I always review, test, and think critically before using AI output.
**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**
I will not share passwords or sensitive data, I will anonymize information, and I will follow company security rules.

🛠️ Task

**Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.**
I can use an AI tool to help write test cases faster based on requirements.

**Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?**
The AI output was helpful but needed editing and fact-checking. I had to adjust steps, add edge cases, and make sure it matched the real product.

**Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.**
I will use AI only as a support tool, always review the results, and never share confidential or sensitive information.
