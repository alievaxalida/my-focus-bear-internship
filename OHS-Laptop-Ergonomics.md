🏆 Milestone: Company Policies
🏢 Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work
🎯 Goal
Understand how to set up a safe and ergonomic workspace, especially when using a laptop, and develop habits to prevent strain and discomfort.

❓ Why is this important?
Many people work directly on their laptops without an external monitor or keyboard, leading to poor posture, neck strain, and wrist discomfort. Making simple adjustments can prevent long-term injuries and improve focus.

🔍 Research & Learn

**What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?**
Neck and shoulder strain from looking down
Wrist and hand pain from typing on the laptop keyboard
Back pain from poor posture
Eye strain from screen height or small text

**What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)**
Laptop stand to raise the screen
External keyboard and mouse for better hand position
Ergonomic chair with back support
Footrest if needed

**What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?**
Monitor or laptop top at eye level
Chair height so feet are flat on the floor
Desk at elbow height for typing
Sit upright, shoulders relaxed

**What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)**
Take short breaks every 30–60 minutes
Stretch arms, neck, and back
Check and correct posture regularly
Use the 20-20-20 rule for eyes (look 20 feet away every 20 minutes for 20 seconds)

📝 Reflection

**What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)**
I can use a laptop stand and an external keyboard to improve posture and reduce strain.

**What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)**
I will sit upright, keep the screen at eye level, and take movement breaks regularly.

**How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)**
I can use Focus Bear reminders to schedule movement and posture checks during the day.

🛠️ Task

**Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.**
I raised my laptop with a stand and positioned an external keyboard and mouse.

**Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.**
Laptop stand and external keyboard improve neck and hand comfort.

**Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)**
I used Focus Bear reminders for breaks and noticed less fatigue at the end of the workday.

**Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.**
I now take 5-minute movement breaks every hour and keep my laptop screen at eye level.
