Agile Workflows & Kanban

🔍 Research & Learn

**How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?**
A Kanban board shows all tasks in one place. Tasks move from left to right as work progresses. It helps teams see priorities, track progress, and stay organized.

**What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)**
Backlog / Not Started: Tasks that are planned but not started yet
In Progress: Tasks the team is currently working on
Blocked: Tasks that cannot continue due to issues
Done / Completed: Tasks that are finished and approved

**How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?**
Team members move their tasks from column to column as work progresses. Everyone is responsible for updating their own tasks regularly.

**What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**
Prevents overload
Helps focus on fewer tasks at a time
Improves quality and speed
Makes workflow easier to manage

📝 Reflection

**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**
Kanban shows all tasks clearly and limits WIP. This helps me focus on the most important tasks and avoid taking on too much at once.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**
I can break tasks into smaller steps, update the board regularly, and focus on one task at a time until it is done.

🛠️ Task

**Create a kanban board for your repo with relevant columns (e.g. not started, in progress, ready for review, approved by bot)**
I have created a GitHub Project board named "Manual QA Onboarding - Khalida Aliyeva" with customized columns.

**Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.**
I moved the "Agile Workflows & Kanban" issue from 'Backlog' to 'Approved by Bot' to demonstrate my understanding of the workflow.

**Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.**
I will start using GitHub 'Labels' to categorize bugs by severity, which will help me prioritize my testing efforts more effectively.
