🔍 Research & Learn

**What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)**
Professional behaviour includes being polite, replying on time, listening in meetings, and respecting others’ opinions.
Unprofessional behaviour includes rude messages, ignoring teammates, interrupting others, or making inappropriate jokes.

**What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)**
It means using a polite tone, writing clear messages, listening to others, and staying calm during disagreements. Feedback should be respectful and focused on work, not people.

**How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)**
Give feedback by focusing on actions, not personal traits. Be calm and clear.
When receiving feedback, listen carefully, ask questions if needed, and avoid reacting defensively.
